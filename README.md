I am a pre-final year Student at SRM Institute of Science and Technology. Creating something new and unique is more like a passion for me, it drives me crazy and it keeps me sane. According to me, "Life is all about control" and hence, YES I exercise control in every aspect of my life, from efficient and clean codes to my guitar ;)
